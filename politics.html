                    <p>Ghana is a unitary presidential constitutional democracy with a parliamentary multi-party system that is dominated by two parties the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP).</p>
                    <p>Ghana vacillated between civilian and military governments until January 1993, when the military government gave way to the Fourth Republic of Ghana after presidential and parliamentary elections in late 1992. The 1992 constitution of Ghana divides powers among a Commander-in-Chief of the Ghana Armed Forces (President of Ghana), parliament (Parliament of Ghana), cabinet (Cabinet of Ghana), the council of state (Ghanaian Council of State), and an independent judiciary (Judiciary of Ghana). The Government of Ghana is elected by universal suffrage after every four years.</p>

In order for laws to be enacted, legislation must have the approval of the president. Additionally, the president has qualified veto over all bills except those to which a vote of urgency is attached. Members are elected for a four-year term in single-seat constituencies by simple plurality vote. This voting system epitomizes <a href="#">Duverger's law</a>, which asserts that single-ballot majoritarian elections with single-member districts are inclined to favor a two-party system.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, with this voting system in place, it has confined Ghanaian politics into a two-party system, which means that there are two dominant political parties, which makes it extremely daunting for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. Elections have been held every four years since 1992. Presidential and parliamentary elections are held alongside each other, generally on 7 December.</p>

They include the Superior Courts of Judicature, established under the 1992 Constitution, and the Inferior Courts, established by Parliament. The Superior Courts are, from highest to lowest, the Supreme Court of Ghana, the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice, and the ten Regional Tribunals. The Inferior Courts, since the Courts Act 2002, include the Circuit Courts, the Magistrate Courts, and special courts such as the Juvenile Courts.
